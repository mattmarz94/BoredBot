# BoredBot

I am developing a small application to apply and enhance the API skills I am currently learning and deepening my understanding of. 

This application will feature a small button that, when clicked, sends a request to the 'Bored API.' This API will then respond with a random activity which can be done to alleviate your boredom.

I am learning how to better understand the client to server and how they interact with each other. 
Using the fetch syntax this was all made possible as it helped me see the requests and responses from the API which I could then use to build this application.
